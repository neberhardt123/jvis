# JVIS
JVIS is a lightweight red teaming platform built on Django, that handles concurrent nmap scans and displays the results in a web interface. jVis provides a python client script that can be used to run nmap scans on networks and return the results to the jVis server.  This tool is a successor of [nVis] (https://github.com/Menn1s/nVis), improving several of its limiations and shortcomings. Several new features include a dynamic search bar, edit forms, and a diagram generator.
